Full article: http://xaviesteve.com/2899/ipad-iphone-mobile-html-css-template-for-web-apps/

iPad/iPhone template made in pure HTML and CSS (no JavaScript needed) that works perfectly on any modern browser (iPad (including iPad 3), iPhone, tablets, mobiles, laptops, etc.). The template uses responsive queries to hide the sidebar in iPad portrait mode and in the iPhone and smaller screens (you can disable that easily if you want to).

This template is the perfect start for any front-end or back-end developer to build complex web apps without spending time on developing the main structure. Or even to create a mobile version of your current site.

The code has been developed so that there is no “divitis”, completely optimized, semantically correct and minimal HTML code. There are no images or animations at all, everything has been coded using some of the latest CSS3 available features and tested it in most modern browsers. Ready for you to download and start developing. These are some of the template’s features:

## Features

### Look and feel

The designs looks and feels as a default app from Apple.

### App-ready

You can install this template as a normal App Store app, removing the Safari top navigation bar and enjoying the full screen.

### Responsive Web Design

Hides the sidebar in iPhone, mobiles and iPad portrait mode. Adapts nicely to the full screen.

### No images

The whole template has been built without requiring any images which means less server queries and increased bandwidth savings.

### Anchor texts (links)

The whole clickable area is active so that even fat fingers can click comfortably.

### Scrollable

Both the sidebar and the main content can be scrolled separately in the iPad and other touch screen tablets.

### Tables

Fully flexible and liquid tables that allow you to include more information while keeping the same look and feel as in any Apple app.

### Forms

Fillable textboxes, password fields, select dropdowns and buttons.

### Fully tested in several devices

Works great in:

* iPhone 4
* iPhone 3GS
* iPad 2
* Samsung Galaxy Tab (GT-P7510)
* Safari 5
* Chrome 16
* Firefox 9

Graceful degradation: IE9 (no rounded corners), IE8.

Not working:

* (none tested yet, IE6 I guess)
